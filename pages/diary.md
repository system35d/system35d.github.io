It's been a few months since I switched to Dart from Python. I find Dart is way better than Python in many ways. I understand how strong type system makes programming easier, and why Python 3 added some features for type system.

I've been writing codes with only dynamic programming languages such as Python, JS, PHP, and so on. Finally I understand why type system does matter.

In addition, Dart is pretty good at Asynchronous Programming. By default, Dart's Asynchronous programming is somehow close to Rx. It saves me from the mess of asynchronous.

So then. I made my mind. I switch to Dart. Although Python has more the optimistic future and machine learning is worthwhile more than app dev. But I cound't... I have no way to go.

Anyway, Dart fits and very suitable for me.

I wish dart will have more capabilities with JS. I would write front end codes with Dart if Dart in web get better. But for now, it doesn't go well as I wish.

**"Practice makes it perfect"**

That seems true. So then, I start writing something from now on. Hope I can do and it will goes well.

**"Don't be afraid of making mistakes"**

As long as I'm writing something with mistakes and errors in my personal blog, it doesn't bother someone. It's okay.

It's about time.
