**"Practice makes it perfect"**

That seems true. So then, I start writing something from now on. Hope I can do and it will goes well.

**"Don't be afraid of making mistakes"**

As long as I'm writing something with mistakes and errors in my personal blog, it doesn't bother someone. It's okay.

It's about time.
